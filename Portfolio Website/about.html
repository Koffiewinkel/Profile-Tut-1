                        Hi, welcome to my blog.
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Each of the images will tell you a story. A story of how my journey with Acute Chronic Pain Syndrome started. As well as all the operations and procedures that was done
                        over the last 4 years. I will also tell you as to how i always try to keep a positive mindset. Some weeks were extremely rough, and some weeks were at least managable.
                        My goal is to have weekly updates on how I try to manage my pain, as well as how it has affected my emotions, and my relationship with the woman I love so deeply.
